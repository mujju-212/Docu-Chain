NOW MOVEN TO EACH OPTION IN  SIDE BAR HERE MOST OF THEM ARE SAME FOR THE OTHER TWO ROLES STUDENT AND STAFF


FILE MANGER:- THIS IS THE SAME FOR ALL THE USER THE WORKING OF THIS FILE MANGER BUT TO THER DOCUMENTS 
THE WOKING OF THE FILE MANGER IS LIKE THEY CAN UPLOAD THE DOCUMENT TO THE IPFS FROM HERE BY CLIKING ON UPLOAD THEY CAN ORGANIZE THE FILES BY CRAETING THE FOLDER  THEY CAN FILTER AND SORT BY THE FOLDER TYPE OF FILE LAST EDIT SIZE NAME AND IN THREE DOT OF FILE THEY CAN SEE DOWNLOAD EWNAME SHARE VERSIONS  PROPERTY  COPY CUT DELETE UPDATE ADD TO QUICK HERE THE SHARE OPTION  IS LIKE THEY CAN SHRE TO ANY ONE HE HAS CONNECTED IN THE INSTITUION OR SEARCH THEM AND SHARE THEM BY SELECT WHAT PERMISSION THEY  HAVE LIKE READ WRITE THEN CLICK TO SHARE  THIS U CAN SEE IN CHAT TO WHOM U HAVE SHRED     AND THE VERSION IS LIKE U CAN SEE THE VERSIONOF THE FILE WHAT AND ALL CHANGED WHEN LIKE THOS THING IN PROPERTIES IF U CLICK U CAN SEE NAME SIZE WHEN CREATED LAST MODIFIED  OWNER WHAT ACCES DO U HAVE   THE FILE IPFS HASH SAHRED WITH   WHAT IS THE PRESENT HASH 

FOLDER THREE DOTS HERE U CAN SEE THE SHARE PROPERTY COPY MOVE DELETE RENAME SAMEE SHARE OPTION  THE IF THEY CLICK TO SHARE THEY SHAR EALL THE FOLDER CONTENT TO THEM WITH WHAT PERMISSION THEY ALLOWING PROPERTY ARE ALMOST SAME TO THE FILE WE CAN COPY PASTE IN  ANY FOLDER THESE ARE IN DATABSE ONLY AND DELETE OPTION IS LIKE WE UNPINING IT WE ARE THINKING IF THEY CLICK TO DELETE IT DONâ€™T DIRECTLY UNPIN HERE IN DAT BASE IT SHOWS DELET BUT IT STORE IN TRASH AFTER CLEARING TRASH ONLY THEY UNPIN IN TRASH IT STAY FOR 30 DAYS BEFORE THAT THEY CAN RCOVER IT R ELSE IT AUTOMATICALLY UNPIN IT  

HEREIN FILE MANGER WE HAVE  SIDE BAR WE HAVE MY FILE IT OPEN S THE WHOLE FILEMANGER THING FOLDER AND ALL AND RECENT IT SHOWS RECENT FILE SHARE WITH HERE YOU CANN SEE FILE OR FOLDER SHARED WITH USER AND USER HAVE SHRED TO OTHER AND  STARED HERE U CAN SEE THE U ADDED QUICK FILES AND FOLDERS  AND TRASH 
HERE WE STORE IN THE BLOCK CHAIN IS OWNERSHIP IPFS HASH CRETED TIME STAMP FILE APPROVAL STATUS IF REQUESTED APPROVER WALLET TIME OFAPPROVED 
OTHER THEN THIS SOME PREDEFINED I MEAN SYSTEM CREATED FOLDER ALSO THER LIKE SAHRED
WHERE THE SHRED FILES ARE ORGAINZED WHTHERE FROM FILE MANGER OR FROM CHAT OTHER FILE LIKE APPROVAL FILE IN THAT OTHER TWO FOLDER ONE MY REQUESRT ANOTHER IS REQUEST RECEVIED HERE IT SHOWS THE LATEST VERSION OF THE FILES RECEVIED IF THEY CLICK ON THE VERSION WE CAN SEE THE OLD VERSIONS LIKE THAT DRAFT FOLDER WHERE THE DRAFT FILES ARE STORED LIKE WE HAVE THE DOCUMENT GENERATION WHERE THE PREDEFINED TEMPLATES ARE THERE  WE HAVE GIVEN THE OPTION  OF DRAFT IT STORE THE DRAFT IN BLOCK  THAT FILES  ACCESSED BY HERE  
Chat interfaces:-this is also same for the THRE ROLES HERE USER CAN SEARCH PEOPLE AND CONNECT THEM ONCE THEY CONNECT THEY CAN CHAT WITH EACHER OTHER AND SHARE THE 
FILES WITH EACHER SHAREING IS SAME AS I MENTIONED IN THE FILE MANGER SHAREING OTHER THEN SHARING THEY CAN CHOOSE APPROVAL REQUEST ALSO IS I WILL EXPLAIN IN  DETAILED IN THIS PARTICULAR TOOL ONLY SAME PROCESS IS APPLIED HERE ALSO OTHER THEN CHAT HERE WE HAVE GROUPS SOME GOUPS ARE CREATED BY DEFAULT AND U JOIN THEM AUTOMATICALLY LIKE IF DEPARTMENT GROUP IS CREATED WHEN THE ADMIN CREATE THE GROUP HE IS THE ADMI OF THAT GROUP THEN WHEN EVER A USER CREATE A ACCOUNT GIVENING THE DEPARTMENT HE AUTOMATICALLY BECOME THE MEMBER OF THE GROUP SIMMILARLY THE SECTION GROUPS ALSO CREATED AND THE UNIVERL GROUP IS COLLEGE GROUP ONCE THE COLLEGE INSTITUE IS CREATED WHICH FIRST STEP THEN ONLY IT IS CREATED IT IS FOR ALL USER IN THAT COLLEGE OR INSTITUE OTHER THEN THAT USER CAN CREATED THERE OWN GROUPS HERE CHATING AND ALL IS THE DATABASE STORED BUT THE FILE SHARING AND APPROVAL ONLY ON BLOCK CHAIN OTHER THEN THIS WE HAVE THE CIRCULAR HERE U CAN SEE  WHAT AND ALL THE LATEST CIRCULAR BY THE COLLEGE IT LIKE THE FEED INSTAGRAM FEED N CHAT ALSO USER CAN SEE THE PROFILE DETAILES ALSO LIKE IN WATSAP THEY CAN SEE CONNECTED USER NAME UNIQUE ID STUDENT OR STAFF OR ADMIN ETC THEY CAN SEARCH PEOPLE BY THERE NAME UNIQUE ID
