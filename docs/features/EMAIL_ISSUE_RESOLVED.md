# 🎉 DocuChain Email Integration - ISSUE RESOLVED!

## ✅ **Problem Fixed Successfully**

### 🚨 **Original Issue:**
- Frontend was getting **404 (NOT FOUND)** errors on `/api/auth/forgot-password`
- No emails were being received for forgot password or registration

### 🔧 **Root Cause Identified:**
The frontend API base URL was inconsistent with backend route registration:
- **Frontend**: Calling `http://localhost:5000/auth/*` (no /api prefix)  
- **Backend**: Routes registered as `/api/auth/*` (with /api prefix)

### 🛠️ **Solution Applied:**

#### 1. **API Endpoint Alignment**
- ✅ Corrected frontend `API_URL` back to `http://localhost:5000/api`
- ✅ Fixed all hardcoded API calls in components to include `/api` prefix
- ✅ Ensured consistency across Login.js, Register.js, and ForgotPassword.js

#### 2. **Files Updated:**
- `frontend/src/services/api.js` - Base API URL corrected
- `frontend/src/components/ForgotPassword.js` - All endpoints fixed
- `frontend/src/components/Register.js` - All endpoints fixed  
- `frontend/src/components/Login.js` - Institution endpoints fixed
